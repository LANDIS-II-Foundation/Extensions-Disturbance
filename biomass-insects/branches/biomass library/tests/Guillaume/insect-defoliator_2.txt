MeanTimeBetweenOutbreaks	41

NeighborhoodSize	1000		<< meters

InitialPatchShapeCalibrator 1.0 << must be <= 1.0 Higher = Rounder; Lower = tracks host quality closer.
								<< Lower this number to lower probabilities of patch generation, i.e. start fewer patches.
InitialPatchOutbreakSensitivity 1.0 << between 0-1; 1.0 = patches are seeded everywhere specified by patch size distr. ; <1.0 reduces the potential area for generating outbreak patches

InitialPatchDistribution Gamma 	<< Weibull, Beta, or Gamma; values taken from D'aoust et al. 2004
									<< Patch size distribution should be based on patch area distribution.
InitialPatchValue1 25 << mean of the function; Alpha parameter, must be > 0.0
InitialPatchValue2 0.8 << spread of the function; depends on the distribution, must be > 0.0 

SpeciesParameters
MortalityEstimate  7Year  << 'Annual' or '7Year'; the 7 year seems to better fit SBW data, even if annual data are available; based on various refs, for details see file: "test distributions du biomass insect.xlsx"
